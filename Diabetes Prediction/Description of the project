Initially, I imported the required libraries and proceeded to analyze the dataset for null values. Following that, I tallied the occurrences of the Outcome variable and computed the mean for each feature.
Then I standardized the data, as the values of different features were in different scales, so it was neccessary to convert them in a similar scale.
The trained and tested the data, and applied the Support Vector Machine for prediction and calculated the accuracy score.
