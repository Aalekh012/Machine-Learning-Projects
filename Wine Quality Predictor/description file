This project predicts the quality of wine.
For making a wine quality predictor, first I imported the libraires and dataset.
Then next step was to clean the dataset.
Also I visualized the data by plotting bar plot between dependent and independent variables.
After that, Preprocessing of data was done, for preprocessing I performed label binarization in which wine quality whose quality value comes out to be greater than 7 is regarded as good wine. 
Then Splitting of data into training and testing datasets.
After splitting, model was trained using the random forest classifier.
Evaluated the model by finding its accuracy on training dataset.
Finally, made a predictive system to predict the quality of wine as good or bad.
